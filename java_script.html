    <p>You can either write it in a script tag or in an external javascript file. It will either be at the top of a website’s code or the bottom.</p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>Variables are ways to store information, the three main ones are var, let, const (Which is unchangeable.) Also var is a very old one, in fact it was the only way to store a number, which is information. Var has a funny scope; Javascript breaks the rules, so what you have to do is not use var, only let and const.</p>

    <h2>Objects & Lists</h2>
    <p>Most objects are stored in a variable, stored in a list. The best way to think about this is that instead of numbers, words are being stored. And you can store as many things that you want in a list and the best part is that it's all stored in memory. If you need to refer to an object, you don’t need the square brackets. Just use a period. But in the code the list needs to be in the {} brackets, so the <em>"keys"</em> are working properly.</p>

    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>To make an array you need to let variables equal a series of numbers/words within square brackets. You can get one value by putting the vaule number in squre brackts. You can print the third number in the array like that.
You can also tell it how to get it's length. Useing -1 in squres will output the last number in the array.</p>

    <h3>Forloops</h3>
    <p>Loops are useful for doing something over and over again with the code, like with the above example</p>
    <p>The first loop is to loop through until it is less than 5, with the start number being 0, increment by a value of one, and than print out the number that you get. The second loop is to loop thoguh starting at zero, until i is less than the array length, than output the number used for i, the length of the array, and the array value of i</p>
    <h3>If/Else</h3>
    <p>If you need to make a sernico for something then I have the right one for you. If there’s a condition met, use it. If not; don’t use it. If there’s an else if then there’s most likely three or more conditions being met.</p>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
    <p>This relates to math, all of the operators that are used in math will apply here. Oh! By the way the parseInt; converts a string to an integer. This can be used in a function which allows you to make your own set of commands which is really handy.</p>
